This repository demonstrates a subtle but important issue related to the `removeIf` function in Kotlin when used with mutable collections. The `removeIf` function removes elements from a collection based on a given predicate. However, when used in conjunction with iterators, unexpected behavior may occur, as shown in the provided code example. The `Bug.kt` file contains code showcasing this issue. The `BugSolution.kt` file offers potential solutions to mitigate these issues.
